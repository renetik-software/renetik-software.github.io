  text = 'I started with this framework few years ago with my first Android application ' +
    'and made similar framework with similar classes for iOS too so ' +
    'I could write more easily two applications from my client fro both platforms, ' +
    'one for Android and other for iOS while keeping similar structure of code. ' +
    'Then framework mutated as I was easily developing apps further and 3 months ago ' +
    'I rewrote this framework to kotlin and polished while removing large old unused parts ' +
    'with idea to release it for others and showcase how I code for development clients or companies ' +
    'who can hire me for software development.<br/> ' +
    'I did not try to re-invent the wheel but with background from multiple platforms ' +
    'and languages I just see how things can be done nicely without some over-complexities of Android framework ' +
    'like activities lifetime, fragments, java listeners and so on. ' +
    'For example I missed event classes similar to that used in c# and other programming patterns, ' +
    'like Navigation from iOS so I made them. ' +
    'I am sure there are number of other libraries that already has those features, ' +
    'with some pros and cons, but I was able to keep this code functional ' +
    'and useful for me for quite a few years so I dont need to look for code from others ' +
    'that can be quite difficult to fix if problems happens. I always tried to use good libraries, ' +
    'but for example CSEvent classes are quite old maybe 7 years now, ' +
    'and are still quite useful and well tested by time. ' +
    'So I believe it\'s good time to share this with some guide how this can be used ' +
    'for rapid and high quality application development.'
